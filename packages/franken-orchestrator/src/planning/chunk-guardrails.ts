export const CHUNK_GUARDRAILS =
  `IMPORTANT RULES — do NOT violate these:\n` +
  `- Do NOT run "gh pr create" or create pull requests. PR creation is handled by the orchestrator after all chunks complete.\n` +
  `- Do NOT delete, move, or modify chunk/plan files. They are read-only inputs.\n` +
  `- Do NOT run "git push". The orchestrator manages pushing.\n` +
  `- Do NOT delete source code files unless the chunk explicitly requires it.\n`;
