## Project: franken-planner (MOD-04 — The Executive)

**franken-planner** is the Planning and Decomposition module of the **Frankenbeast** AI agent system. It converts complex user goals into structured, executable plans represented as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) of tasks.

### Responsibility

- Receive sanitized intent from **MOD-01** (Guardrails)
- Decompose goals into DAG task graphs with objectives, required skills, and dependencies
- Select and execute planning strategies: Linear, Parallel, Recursive
- Enforce Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationale before every tool call
- Recover from failures via dynamic replanning (inserting fix-it subtasks)
- Pause for Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) approval on "0 to 1" builds
- Surface rationale to **MOD-07** (Self-Critique) for pre-execution verification

### Frankenbeast Module Map

| Module | Role                       | Relationship to MOD-04                                       |
| ------ | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| MOD-01 | Guardrails                 | Provides sanitized input; can block actions                  |
| MOD-02 | `@djm204/agent-skills`     | Tool/skill discovery — MOD-04 queries available capabilities |
| MOD-03 | Episodic & Semantic Memory | Provides ADRs, project rules, known errors for context       |
| MOD-04 | **This module — Planning** | Owns the DAG, strategies, CoT, HITL, self-correction         |
| MOD-07 | Self-Critique              | Receives CoT rationale; verifies logic before execution      |

### Tech Stack

| Concern     | Choice                  | Rationale                                |
| ----------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Language    | TypeScript 5.x (strict) | Type-safe module boundaries; see ADR-001 |
| Runtime     | Node.js 22 LTS          | Stable, LTS, native ESM                  |
| Testing     | Vitest                  | ESM-native, fast; see ADR-003            |
| Package mgr | pnpm                    | Fast, strict hoisting                    |
| Build       | tsc                     | Direct TS compilation                    |
| Linting     | ESLint + Prettier       | Enforced in CI                           |

### Key Architectural Decisions

See `docs/adr/` for full records. Summary:

| ADR     | Decision                                                    |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| ADR-001 | TypeScript strict mode                                      |
| ADR-002 | DAG as adjacency list (no external graph library)           |
| ADR-003 | Vitest as test framework                                    |
| ADR-004 | Strategy pattern for Linear / Parallel / Recursive planners |
| ADR-005 | Typed interfaces at all module boundaries (DI-friendly)     |
| ADR-006 | HITL via Markdown checklist export + async Promise approval |
| ADR-007 | Immutable DAG with versioned snapshots for replanning       |

### Development Workflow

- **TDD**: Write failing test first, then implement. No feature code without a test.
- **ADRs**: Document every significant architectural decision in `docs/adr/` before coding.
- **Atomic commits**: One logical change per commit. Format: `type(scope): message`.
- **Small PRs**: Each PR maps to one feature phase. PRs ship a working vertical slice.
- **HITL gate**: Planner pauses and exports a Markdown checklist before executing "0 to 1" builds.

### Commit Convention

```
feat(dag): implement topological sort with cycle detection
test(planner): add unit tests for RecursivePlanner
fix(hitl): handle user abort in approval flow
docs(adr): add ADR-005 module interface contracts
chore(ci): add Vitest coverage threshold gate
```

This project uses AI-assisted development. Rules in `.cursor/rules/` provide guidance.

## Installed Templates

- **Shared** (always included): Core principles, code quality, security, git workflow, communication
- **javascript-expert**: Principal-level JavaScript & TypeScript engineering (Node.js, React, type system, testing)
- **testing**: Comprehensive testing practices (TDD, test design, CI/CD integration, performance testing)
- **qa-engineering**: Quality assurance programs for confident, rapid software delivery
- **ml-ai**: Machine learning and AI systems (model development, deployment, monitoring)
